> Mobile App that gives ghana updated news scrap from GhanaWeb.

### üè† [Overview](https://github.com/Rexfordasamoah51/News360)

News360 is a mobile app built with Flutter. Due to fewer couple data around for building news app for my country. I try using the magic of dart Scraping in order for me to populate the data inside the app. The source data is streamed from Ghanaweb.com
